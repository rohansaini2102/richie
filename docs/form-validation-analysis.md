# ClientOnboardingForm Validation Analysis

## Form Submission Issues Summary

### Critical Issue: Hard-coded Validation Check
The form has a hard-coded validation in the `onSubmit` function (lines 618-630) that checks for these specific required fields:
- `firstName`
- `lastName` 
- `email`
- `incomeType`
- `investmentExperience`
- `riskTolerance`
- `monthlyInvestmentCapacity`

**If ANY of these fields are missing, form submission is blocked.**

## Common Issues Preventing Submission

### 1. Not Reaching Step 7
- Submit button only appears on Step 7
- Users might get stuck on earlier steps due to validation errors

### 2. Phone Number Format Issues
- Must be EXACTLY: `+91-1234567890` format
- Common mistakes: missing +91-, wrong number of digits, extra spaces/characters

### 3. PAN Number Format Issues  
- Must be EXACTLY: `ABCDE1234F` format (5 letters, 4 digits, 1 letter)
- Common mistakes: lowercase letters, wrong pattern, extra spaces

### 4. Missing Step 7 Required Fields
- `investmentExperience` - Must select from dropdown
- `riskTolerance` - Must select from dropdown  
- `monthlyInvestmentCapacity` - Must enter positive number

### 5. Step-by-Step Validation Blocking
- Each step validates before allowing "Next"
- If validation fails, user cannot proceed to next step
- Error messages may not be clear enough

## Debugging Tips

### Check Form Values in Browser Console
```javascript
// In browser console on the form page:
console.log('Current form values:', document.querySelector('form'));
```

### Check React Hook Form State
The form uses React Hook Form, so validation errors are stored in the `errors` object and displayed as red text under fields.

### Check Network Tab
If form reaches submission but fails, check Network tab for API call errors.
