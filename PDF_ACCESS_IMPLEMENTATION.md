# PDF Report Access Implementation

## Problem Solved
After saving a financial plan, users were being redirected to `/clients/:clientId` but had no way to access the PDF reports generated by the Frontend jsPDF Generation with database storage.

## Solution Overview
Added a comprehensive PDF Reports section to the Client Details page that allows users to:
- **View all stored PDF reports** for the client across all financial plans
- **Access PDF viewing/download functionality** directly from the client page
- **Generate new reports** through the existing plan creation modal

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. New Component: `ClientPDFReportsSection.jsx`
**Location:** `/frontend/src/components/client/ClientPDFReportsSection.jsx`

**Features:**
- Lists all PDF reports across all financial plans for a client
- Displays report metadata (version, date, type, size, content summary)
- Provides actions: View, Download, Delete for each report
- Shows report type badges (Goal-Based Plan, Cash Flow Plan, etc.)
- Integrates with existing PDF storage API endpoints
- Includes confirmation dialog for report deletion
- "Generate New Report" button that opens plan creation modal

**Key Functions:**
- `loadClientReports()` - Fetches all plans and their PDF reports
- `viewReport()` - Opens PDF in new browser tab
- `downloadReport()` - Downloads PDF to user's machine
- `deleteReport()` - Removes PDF from database with confirmation

### 2. Modified: `ClientDetailView.jsx`
**Location:** `/frontend/src/components/client/ClientDetailView.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Added import for `ClientPDFReportsSection`
- Integrated PDF Reports section after Plan History
- Connected "Generate New Report" button to existing plan creation modal
- Passed client information and modal handler to PDF Reports component

## User Experience Flow

### Current Enhanced Flow:
1. **Save Plan** → Redirect to `/clients/:clientId`
2. **View Client Details** → See complete client information
3. **PDF Reports Section** → View all generated PDF reports
4. **Report Actions:**
   - **View**: Opens PDF in new tab for immediate viewing
   - **Download**: Saves PDF to local machine
   - **Delete**: Removes PDF from database (with confirmation)
5. **Generate New Report**: Opens plan creation modal → Select Goal-Based Planning → Generate and store new PDF

## Technical Integration

### API Integration
- Uses existing PDF storage endpoints:
  - `GET /api/plans/:planId/pdf/all` - List all PDFs for a plan
  - `GET /api/plans/:planId/pdf/report/:reportId` - Download specific PDF
  - `DELETE /api/plans/:planId/pdf/report/:reportId` - Delete PDF
- Fetches reports across multiple financial plans for comprehensive view
- Handles authentication with JWT tokens from localStorage

### UI Components
