# ðŸš¨ SECURITY ALERT - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## Exposed Credentials Detected

**Date:** 2025-07-28  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** RESOLVED IN CODE - CREDENTIALS STILL NEED ROTATION

## What Was Exposed

The following credentials were found exposed in the codebase:

1. **MongoDB Atlas URI** with username/password
2. **Claude AI API Key** 
3. **Daily.co API Key**
4. **Gmail App Password**

## Files That Were Fixed

âœ… **Fixed:**
- `backend/test-transcription.js` - Removed hardcoded MongoDB URI
- `docs/progress/work-history.md` - Masked credentials in documentation
- `docs/claude/session-memory.md` - Masked MongoDB URI
- `backend/.env.example` - Updated template with proper placeholders

## Actions Taken

1. âœ… Removed hardcoded credentials from all code files
2. âœ… Updated documentation to use placeholder values
3. âœ… Created comprehensive `.env.example` template
4. âœ… Verified `.gitignore` files protect `.env` files

## CRITICAL: CREDENTIALS MUST BE ROTATED

**The exposed credentials in `backend/.env` are still active and MUST be rotated immediately:**

### 1. MongoDB Atlas
- Log into MongoDB Atlas console
- Rotate database user password
- Update `MONGODB_URI` in `.env`

### 2. Claude AI API Key  
- Log into Anthropic Console
- Create new API key
- Delete old API key
- Update `CLAUDE_API_KEY` in `.env`

### 3. Daily.co API Key
- Log into Daily.co dashboard
- Generate new API key
- Revoke old API key
- Update `DAILY_API_KEY` in `.env`

### 4. Gmail App Password
- Log into Google Account settings
- Delete current app password
- Generate new app password
- Update `EMAIL_PASS` in `.env`

## Prevention Measures

1. âœ… `.gitignore` properly configured to exclude `.env` files
2. âœ… Environment template provided for safe setup
3. âœ… Documentation uses placeholder values only

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATELY** rotate all exposed credentials
2. Monitor for any unauthorized access using old credentials
3. Review git history for any other exposed secrets
4. Consider implementing pre-commit hooks to prevent future exposures

**Remember:** Never commit `.env` files or hardcode credentials in source code.
